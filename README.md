## Installing Scout iOS

**Make sure [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is installed:**
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Clone this repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/charlon/scout-ios-turbolinks
```
And then run
```
$ cd scout-ios-turbolinks
$ pod install
```

Open the __**.xcworkspace**__ that was created. This should be the file you use everyday to work within Xcode.
